# 🧠 N8N AI Automation Portfolio
Hi, I’m Ciaran — an aspiring AI automation specialist focused on building real-world automations using [n8n](https://n8n.io/), AI agents, and open-source tools.

This portfolio documents my learning path from simple beginner automations to advanced workflows solving practical business problems. All projects are built with the intention to showcase:
- Automation skills in real-world use cases
- API integrations and creative problem solving
- AI-enhanced workflows (with agents, classifiers, summarizers, and more)
- Project documentation and presentation skills
